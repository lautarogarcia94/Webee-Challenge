This SpringBoot API is a CRUD to manage Device Entity. Each one have 3 fields:
* date -> format(DDMMYYYY) and it cannot be before 01012020
* MAC address ->  format(FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
* ID -> int greater than 0, autogenerated by the API


The API accepts GET, POST and DELETE request:

For registering a device, you should make a POST REQUEST to "http://localhost:8080/devices" endpoint, and send the date and MAC 
address in the body of the request: {"date": "21042020","macAddress": "FF:02:FF:00:24:FF"}.

Add to your code:
// 
// Unirest.setTimeouts(0, 0);
// HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.post("http://localhost:8080/devices")
//   .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
//   .header("Accept", "application/json")
//   .body("{\r\n    \"date\": \"21042020\",\r\n    \"macAddress\": \"FF:02:FF:00:24:FF\"\r\n}")
//   .asString();
//

For deleting a registered device, you should make a DELETE REQUEST to "http://localhost:8080/devices/{ID}" endpoint. In {ID} you 
have to put the ID number of the device you want to delete. For example, to delete the device with ID=4 you have to send a DELETE 
request to  "http://localhost:8080/devices/4"

Add to your code: 
//
//  Unirest.setTimeouts(0, 0);
//  HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.delete("http://localhost:8080/devices/4")
//        .asString();
//

For get data of devices registered, there are 3 possibles ways:
1) If you want to get a list of all devices registered, you should make a GET REQUEST to "http://localhost:8080/devices" endpoint.

Add to your code:
// 
// Unirest.setTimeouts(0, 0);
// HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("http://localhost:8080/devices")
//   .body("")
//   .asString();
//

2) If you want to get a device by looking it for its ID, you should make a GET REQUEST to "http://localhost:8080/devices/{ID}" 
endpoint. In {ID} you have to put the ID number of the device you want to get. For example, to get the device with ID=4 you have 
to send a GET request to  "http://localhost:8080/devices/4".

Add to your code:
//
// Unirest.setTimeouts(0, 0);
// HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("http://localhost:8080/devices/4")
//   .asString();
//

3) If you want to get a device by looking it for its MAC address, you should make a GET REQUEST to 
"http://localhost:8080/devices/{MAC Address}" endpoint. In {MAC Address} you have to put the MAC Address of the device you want 
to get. For example, to get the device with MAC Address "12:00:AA:00:23:FF" you have to send a GET request to 
"http://localhost:8080/devices/12:00:AA:00:23:FF".

Add to your code:
//
// Unirest.setTimeouts(0, 0);
// HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("http://localhost:8080/devices/12:00:AA:00:23:FF")
//   .asString();
//
